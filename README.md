This project is a compact hand held device based on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE sense Rev2 board, inspired by the Tricorder from the Star Trek Franchise
It utilzes a variety of on board sensors as well as GPS to gather a range of data.

There is no license to use this code. I would appriciate a mention if used in your own projects or if you choose to follow the build
